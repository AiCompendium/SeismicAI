# Deployment and Integration - Integrate the model into the desired application
# Implement the user interface and integrate the earthquake detection functionality

def detect_earthquake(location_coordinates):
    # Process user input (location_coordinates) and perform feature extraction on new data
    # Scale the features using the previously fitted scaler (scaler.transform)
    # Pass the scaled features through the trained model for earthquake prediction
    # Return the prediction results

# Continuous Monitoring and Improvement - Monitor performance and update the model as needed
# evaluate the model's performance, collect new data, and update the model periodically to improve its accuracy and adaptability.
